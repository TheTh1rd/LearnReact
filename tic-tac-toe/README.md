This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

For this project I followed the reactjs beginner tutorial founf here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html.

From the project directory install the modules with:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
