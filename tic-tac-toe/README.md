## Tic Tac Toe

For this project I followed and expanded on the reactjs beginner tutorial found here: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html.

## setup


From the project directory install the modules with:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To run the app

```bash
npm start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
